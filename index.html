      <h1>Hi! I am Geno Casceillo!</h1>
      <p class="bright">I am from Connecticut and attend <a href="http://www.kings.edu">King's College</a>.</p>
      <p>I love computers and decided that I wish to help people with their daily problems! This summer I worked as an IT guy at a steel company and it was stupendious! I first used a computer when I was a kid and ended up loving every minute. Soon my mom was asking 13 year old me to fix her computer problems. I do not want to code that much in the future but I would love to have the knowledge in my back pocket!</p>
